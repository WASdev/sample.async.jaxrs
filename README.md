# Java EE7: JAX-RS 2.0 Async Request processing

Java EE7 added support for asynchronous request processing of REST requests in JAX-RS 2.0.


This sample contains a few variations to illustrate how to use async request processing in JAX-RS 2.0 applications. It is organized around a generic `Item`, that is manipulated by an `ItemService` that happens to take a long time (it sleeps for a few seconds). Each variation copes with this slow service in a different way, to illustrate how JAX-RS Async requests work and how Concurrency Utilities and EJBs can be used to offload work to other threads while keeping the EE container happy.

* *Items*: [ItemsResource](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsResource.java) uses the `ItemService` to list, add, and fetch items, in the usual (synchronous) way.
* *Async Items*: [ItemsAsyncResource](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsAsyncResource.java) uses the `@Suspended` annotation with the `AsyncResponse` parameter, however, it is still essentially synchronous, as the work is not offloaded to a different thread.
* *Async EJB Items*: [ItemsEJBResource](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsEJBResource.java) defines a stateless EJB, which allows work offloading with the addition of the `@Asynchronous` annotation.
* *Async Items with Executor*: [ItemsExecutorResource](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsExecutorResource.java) looks up the `ManagedExecutorService` defined by EE7 Concurrency Utilities in JNDI. Work for the request is then submitted to the executor and resumed later.
* *Async Items with CDI-provided Executor*: [ItemsCDIExecutorResource](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsCDIExecutorResource.java) uses the `ManagedExecutorService` injected as an @Resource.

`AsyncResponse` objects can be configured to handle timeouts. There are two examples showing that:
* *Async with CDI-provided Executor and Timeout*: [ItemsCDIExecutorResourceTimeout](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsCDIExecutorResourceTimeout.java) sets a timeout, and registers a timeout handler, a connection callback, and a completion callback. Work is queued to a separate thread via a CDI-injected ManagedExecutorService.
* *Async EJB Items with Timeout*: [ItemsEJBResourceTimeout](/async-jaxrs-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/jaxrs/async/ItemsEJBResourceTimeout.java) does the same as the previous example, but uses an asynchronous Stateless EJB instead.

## Getting Started

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:
* [Building and running on the command line](/docs/Using-cmd-line.md)
* [Building and running using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)

Once the server has been started, go to [http://localhost:9081/jaxrs-async/](http://localhost:9081/jaxrs-async/) to interact with the sample.
