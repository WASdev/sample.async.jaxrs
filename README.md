# Java EE7: JAX-RS 2.0 Async Request processing

Java EE7 added support for asynchronous request processing of REST requests in JAX-RS 2.0.


This sample contains a few variations to illustrate how to use async request processing in JAX-RS 2.0 applications. It is organized around a generic `Item`, that is manipulated by an `ItemService` that happens to take a long time (it sleeps for a few seconds). Each variation copes with this slow service in a different way, to illustrate how JAX-RS Async requests work and how Concurrency Utilities and EJBs can be used to offload work to other threads while keeping the EE container happy.

* ItemsResource uses the `ItemService` to list, add, and fetch items, in the usual (synchronous) way.
* ItemsAsyncResource uses the `@Suspended` annotation with the `AsyncResponse` parameter, however, it is still essentially synchronous, as the work is not offloaded to a different thread.
* ItemsEJBResource defines a stateless EJB, which allows work offloading with the addition of the `@Asynchronous` annotation.
* ItemsExecutorResource looks up the `ManagedExecutorService` defined by EE7 Concurrency Utilities in JNDI. Work for the request is then submitted to the executor and resumed later.
* ItemsCDIExecutorResource uses the `ManagedExecutorService` injected as an @Resource.

`AsyncResponse` objects can be configured to handle timeouts. There are two examples showing that:
* ItemsCDIExecutorResourceTimeout sets a timeout, and registers a timeout handler, a connection callback, and a completion callback. Work is queued to a separate thread via a CDI-injected ManagedExecutorService.
* ItemsEJBResourceTimeout does the same as the previous example, but uses an asynchronous Stateless EJB instead.


Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:

* [Building with maven](/docs/Building-the-sample.md#building-with-maven)
* [Downloading WAS Liberty](/docs/Downloading-WAS-Liberty.md)
* [Start the server using the command line, or maven/gradle plugins](/docs/Starting-the-server.md)
